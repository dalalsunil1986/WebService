# Finance RESTWebService

 Here I have developed an **own RESTfull service for Finance** using ** Java, SpringMVC and AngularJS**
 
 
 
 Here various calculations like **Annual Payment Rate(APR), Least Monthly Payment, Loan Monthly Payment and  Loan Number Payment** 
 were implemented. 
 
##### Annual Payment Rate(APR):
* Loan Amount (C)
* Extra Cost (E) 
* Interest Rate % (R)
* No. of Months (N)

##### Least Monthly Payment:
* Loan Amount (C)
* Residual Value (F) 
* Interest Rate % (R)
* No. of Months (N)

##### Loan Monthly Payment:
* Loan Amount (C) 
* Interest Rate % (R)
* No. of Months (N)

##### Loan Number Payment:
* Loan Amount (C) 
* Interest Rate % (R)
* Monthly Payment (P)
